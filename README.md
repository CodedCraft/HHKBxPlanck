## A 3D Printed Ortholinear Keyboard

This repository hosts the design files and firmware for a revolutionary 3D printed keyboard, combining the ergonomic brilliance of the HHKB with the finger-friendly ortholinear layout of the Planck. Crafted entirely through 3D printing, this keyboard boasts a unique blend of form and function, integrating a Nordic nrf52840 chip and running on Zephyr RTOS with ZMK firmware.

## Features

- **Ortholinear Bliss:** Every key is strategically placed for optimal finger comfort and minimal movement.
- **HHKB-inspired Thumb Keys:** Borrowing from the HHKB's design philosophy, the thumb keys offer unparalleled accessibility.
- **Fully 3D Printed:** The entire keyboard, from the plastic plate and switch plate to the case and feet, is crafted using 3D printing technology.
- **Software Customization:** Zephyr RTOS and ZMK firmware provide a powerful platform for programming and customization.
